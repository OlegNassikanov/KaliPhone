# KaliPhone

**KaliPhone** is an idea for a mobile device powered by Linux, with full control for the user.  
No ads. No spying. Only tools for freedom and learning.

## Goals

- Run Kali Linux (ARM version or NetHunter)
- Work on ESP32 or Raspberry Pi
- Have physical switches to turn off camera, mic, modem
- Be small, pocket-sized
- Be fully open-source

This is a DIY project for hackers, makers, and people who love freedom.
